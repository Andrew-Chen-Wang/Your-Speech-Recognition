# Your Speech Recognition

Easy way to fine tune [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech)
voice recognition to your voice by making a website to do it
all for you. Why? Because I couldn't swear, it got distracted by my
static voice due to mic issues (unlike Siri),
and I wanted an automated way for me to train the data rather than constantly
finding something to say then writing it down.
